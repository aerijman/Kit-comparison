# Kit-comparison
Comparison of two kits for mRNA purification


# Description
Goal:
Compare two RNA-seq libraries of the same UHRR + 1% synthetic ERCC control input (10 ng),  prepared with kits from different vendors.
I recommend Salmon for transcript abundance estimation.

Potentially interesting questions:
How sensitive are these two libraries prep methods?
Are high abundance transcripts missing from one or the other library?

What questions arise from your observations?
What other experiments would you design to answer these questions?

Figures that speak to these questions would be helpful.
(e.g. correlations, TPM vs. # of transcripts with at least that TPM (cumulative histogram))
